The course Statistical Methods for Big Data (SDS383) is very useful though it is a bit difficult for me. It encourages me to explore the optimization technique and coding methods. Through this process, I have learned a lot from my classmates. 

> **Ashutosh** has taught me a lot. We are working on the final project and I always rely on him if I need some support. He created great ideas on building the algorithms and showed me how it works. He also explained the basic concepts behind our algorithms to make me fully understand. He is a great guy to collaborate with. Besides, his presentation on car-sharing was marvelous, which I am really interested in doing some research on it.

> **Natalia** has given me great peer reviews which helped me to improve both my coding and write-ups. She provided a lot of useful references in her GitHub page, which are definitely helpful. Her way to solving the problems and showing the results is more like tutorial to me. She also gave an impressive presentation on “The Traffic Assignment Problem Using Frank-Wolfe Algorithm”. This algorithm is a conditional gradient algorithm to solve convex quadratic problem with linear constraints, which will be very useful when I encounter similar problems.

> **Bowen’s** presentations on ADMM and spatial smoothing were great. His interpretation was key to my understanding on each of those topics. I am not really familiar with Python. However, the way Bowen used to show his results in Jupyter Notebook was concise and self-explanatory. I will refer to his code learning Python. 

> **Mauricio’s** presentation on Linear Regression was very impressive and the pattern that he used to write up the solution in his GitHub page is a great way to show his results, which I will adopt in my future write-ups. His presentation always included some explanatory comments, which made me understand the concepts covered easily. When I did exercises02, he also explained to me the basic mathematical techniques behind Gradient and Stochastic Gradient Descent. 

I am really thankful for those I mentioned above, who helped me a lot to improve myself. I hope I was able to reciprocate in turn when they looked to me.
