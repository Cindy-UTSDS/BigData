# Spatial Smoothing at Scale

In this set of exercises, we'll first look at the simplest spatial smoother of all: local averaging. Then we will extend the knowledge of ADMM by considering the problem of spatial smoothing over large discrete lattices. The applications we consider are: 1) atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and 2) data collected from an fMRI experiment.
